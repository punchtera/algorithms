// implement a method to perform basic string compression using the counts of repeated characters.
// For example, the string aabcccccaaa would become a2b1c5a3. if the "compressed" would not become
// smaller than the original string, your method should return the original string.
// assumption: the string has only uppercase and lowecase letters (A-Z)(a-z).
